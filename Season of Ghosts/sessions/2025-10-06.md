# QUEST LOG
- pearls in the sinkholes to own the tea house
    - 1 of 2 acquired

# a lovely chat w/ mugiro & the rescue of dr dami
- zudu (regional manager): leader of the prayers
- mugiro was leader of the rovers
    - they believe they can bring kugapte into this world through bloodshed
- they feel compelled to do things by kugapte

# we head to zudu
- we reach a clearing in the woods, beyond a fallen tree, there's a seething wall of mist 50 ft in the sky, with silently screaming ghosts going crazy

- it's a crazy fight with darkness and tons of defense
- one of the creatures was continuing the ritual through the darkness
    - as the battle ends, 3 creatures pull themselves from the wall
        - long broken limbs, wooden cages as heads filled with blood colored butterflies, long stretchy, disgusting limbs
            - we kill them all, every time we hit them the blood butterflies fade back into the wall
                - this resembles the effigy of kugapte in the ritual room
            - noperrabo throws itself to the ground, and the creature tears its head off
