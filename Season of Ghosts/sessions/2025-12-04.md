# QUEST LOG

# Into the rift we go

- but first some preparations
  - we did them

- we go through tunnel
  - as we step through the fog behind us reseals
  - hasu freaks out about time

- the terrain around us seems all wrong
- the monastary itself is in the valley, it seems like we've skipped the path
  - the forest looks younger
  - we're 1000 years in the past

- the dirt trail comes to an end, in the center of the clearing is a woman's corpse on a rock
  - tan su gin? body lies with a hole in her chest, fog pouring out of the hole in her chest
    - keiko thinks so...legend said her heart got rippped out
    - she's got tattoo's of leaves and vines going up her arms

- it looks like her heart was clawed out by a large creature
- the writing scratched underneath her is in aklo, it says...KU GAP TE
  - all 3 of the girls hear a whisper from the tendrils of fog that say "the seed" in a woman's voice
    - the seed of the tsugi tree is rumored to be tan su gin's heart

- there's a blood trail going north
  - dipper tracks it through the forest...it doesn't seem like footsteps, like a bird took it

- we see broken down, dead tree fall
  - in the center, blood splattered on several decaying timbers, it looks like a giant bird nest

- 3 demons come from the heart, and a big bird
  - a red light emanates from this big dumb bird

- dipper picks up the heart
  - the sound of toppling trees and thunderous footsteps take the air
  - we're surrounded by an intense, angry Evil
  - nature or religion to offer prayers

- hasu runs the heart back and the giant disturbance in the forest leave
  - the body of tsu gin drops into the stone and a sprout sprouts
    - a mountainous tree climbs high into the air, and we return to our timeline

- pilgrims press: traditional walk to the tan sugi monastary
  - built around the ancient tsugi tree
  - willowshore was founded to maintain this path
    - willowshores shift in focus fucked us all

- monastary is located in a secluded valley surrounded by steep mountains, only safe pass is the pilgrims path ~13 miles
  - takes 3 nights at 3 shrines
    - floating platform in the lake
    - secluded dead tree
    - a rocky perch overlooking the path below
  - represents reincarnation

- classic monk bullshit
