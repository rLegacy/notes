- the noppera bo, who delt in the abandoned lumber mill seemed to believe that paradise existed outside, others worshipped kugapte


- opening election rallies
    - cob crushes that shit
    - hasu crafts us some dope ass campaign posters

- ho jon hu, known as one of willowshores most eligible bachelors, he was cooking dinner last night, and he saw a figure outside his window, probably one of these ladies, so he grabbed his sword, maybe a prowler, but what he found was a long dark robed individual, vaguely hummanoid, but made of mist and smoke, with a featureless mask of stone that frightened him to his core
    - we head to his place, and encounter and kill the thing, it scares the shit out of ho and jay
