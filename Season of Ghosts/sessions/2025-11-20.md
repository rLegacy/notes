# week 6, the debate
- the leshy's & verdant mountain summit grass are spreading fear and negative rumors about the time

- 6th research point: the name kugapte is associated with certain old texts w/ the monastary
    - the name of a powerful nindoru fiend
        - when an evil mortal soul is retched from the cycle of reincarnation, it transforms into these fiends.
            - a force of entropy and breaking cycles
            - wield shattered weapons that still function
            - display traits of undead, but they are alive
            - blood red butterflies follow them around
                - physical manifestations of nindoru's thoughts
        - defeated by tan su gin
            - she also perished, and was reincarnated as a towering tansugi tree
    - perhaps more knowledge about the fiend would be in the monastary

- after hosting the rich at the tea house, elizeth comes in
    - ms keating, our kindergarten teacher died
        - she was old
        - her body is gone, it was in her house
            - no signs of breaking and entering, seems like she got up and left
    - we got a lead: you so gin might be up to something
    - tracks from the house lead to the south bank of the river
        - we end up north of the derulean tea house

- she's just sitting on a log
    - yami is here, the cat
        - he reanimated her
        - bakeneko: a real god damn old cat
            - they become more intelligent and gain an affinity for magic
+ 4 lesser healing potions
+ disrupting property rune

- the debate goes crazy
