# mushrooms are icky
- we head south to the crick (dragonfly creek)
- we start to see slime mold and send shi out to take a look around
    - didn't see anything moving, can see that the grove is where all the fungus is

- it's name is `xun goo`
    - chased out by some evil creatures
        - bugs n stuff
        - that was a lie
    - we kick it's ass, but it does infect w/ some fucked up shit
        - she might mushroom tomorrow, only time will tell, `purple pox`
            - we cure her

    - the tree looks better
    - river may have been left behind from the curse
        - there used to be 6-7

# we head to the canary inn
- as the sun sets, we reach a wide spot in the road, tall grass blows in the evening breeze, and we hear some giggling and a "help me"
    - 3 thatchling spawns
        - a red hooded thatchling is an undead creature that creates them, must be near by

- we rock up to the inn
    - the forest road comes to a junction, 1/2 dozen burned structures, northern most is in tact, 3 figures sit in front of the structure
        - 2 hooded figures watch a young child in a red hood sings a song about butterflies
    - we burn one and sing some songs
        - everything feels chill and normal
        - they fade into the ground and disappear, there's some very shallow graves

- we dig out 2 skeletons and inbetween them a red cloak, and bury them, get sick cloak of things

- sumika and wren are back when we get back to town
