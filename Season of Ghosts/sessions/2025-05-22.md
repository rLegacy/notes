# we arrive at the manor
- the two guards guarding the matsuki estates greet us welcomingly
- `nami` (male) and `nara` (female), also twins, our age, children of the guard captain `zheng`, who is also across the river

- in an instant they were surrounded by phantom beasts
    - wolves, ravens
    - more normal than the bosu

- wounded farmers, children, etc are in the manor
    - `Yong`, the blacksmith, `keiko`'s age
    - `Kum Soon-chong`, the vet
    - `You So-Jin`, the herbalist
    - `Matsuki`, one of the olds, is here, drinking
        - he rises, and begs us to come over and eat
            - chicken rice, and dried spicy seaweed


- gotta make contact with the north
    - `granny hue` at the `[ceiba-duyue exchange]`, trade office, towards the east side of town is the place to go

- a farmer mentioned that gurgle gut could be poisoned, `[hand of the spring]` may be a source

- where is ugly cute, hunters from the `[silver mist lodge]`

- we go looking for the hunters, and find a trail
    - we hear a strange commotion, and come across some jenkins
    - were in a strange battle of wits with the 4 abacus sisters

- `Sumeca` teaches us the ritual of how to bless the coins at the shrine

- we need to get 3 coppers blessed from 3 shrines
    - `*Ketephys*` @ `[silvermist lodge]`
    - `*Daikitsu*` @ `[9 tailed fox shrine]`
    - `*Pharasma*` @ `[lady of souls]`


- we go off to the three shrines, and bless the coins, `dipper` stumbles across the last, hidden shrine like she keeps her stuff here

- the sun sets, we're at the gate, the fog starts to clear up, the moon is blood red
- the jenkins are all out with bosu, looking tired

- there is a twitter account called gourd puns, research for later
