# new year new me

- we take our first steps on the path
    - first part of the journey is ~5 miles to the lake spot
    - cool and crisp weather
    - dipper is confused with how preserved the path is for it being abandoned for the past 50 years
        - no tracks, but path looks like it's been traveled frequently and recently
- we stumble upon a lil guy: a very polite kappa
    - `anko` the 3rd, from mirror lake
    - his bowl is empty
        - an evil storm hag tormented him
        - forced me to bow to her, and all the water poured out, damn
        - picked him up and flew him very far away
- by late afternoon, we reach the edge of mirror lake

- she can hurl lightning, strip flesh from the bone with wind, etc..
    - strange distaste for the scent of burning incense
    - they hiss violently
    - we clap their cheeks

- the sun starts to set and we make it to the crazy hexagonal shrine
    - dippers for dipping into the river and clay vials
    - 6 wicker mats lie in a circle around the viewing portal

- dipper knows the prayer we gotta sing
- keiko remembers hearing that this shrine was washed away in a flood

- it does not seem like we've been walking all day, but we arrive in the evening

- we do the prayer


- jay: 8  air remaining
- jay: 7  air remaining
