## set the scene
- we stand in the middle of the downtown area, all 4 of the derulos together, in front of a stage in the town square, last day of spring. `keiko`'s birthday.
    - festival is last day of spring, before summer: season of ghosts
    - townsfolk is in very rounded hoods, lighting red lanterns all around the town
    - it's more party than panicked readying
    - we're here to be "abducted"
    - the last BIG haunting was the night of the broken blades

- 20 years ago, `keiko` was the 200th citizen of willowshore
    - the lumber workers were not really considered citizens, "gentrifiers," but we've grown up with their presence and them leaving is a big deal

- we're very proud of being from here
- the governor is pretty pissed about being here, `Shan-Bao`, `shamwow`
- `Matsuki`, `peepaw`, old elder drunk from the southbank, 99 (NINETY NINE FUCKING YEARS OLD)
    - he likes us
- `Granny Hue`, grandma of northridge, goal is financial independence and stability
    - she's heard from `Luda Bama` that jay is a ok

- it's dangerous to wander through the north woods

- the great willow gave master `Zhi Hui` where to build the monastary, `Tan Sugi` grove

- `cho` our neighbor, the miller, my mannnnn, a very normal miller


## it's stage time baby

    - they poke fun, they still celebrate, `dipper` is a little awkward
- `jubei` the only magician of all time


## go time
- `the three olds` get up on stage, very rounded, kinda tight, black and red, mermaid fit ass robes, with the traditional willow shore seal on the skirt
- only thing that could go wrong is some pesky ghosts show up, big laugh
- we got through the spring, without lung wa, as long as no GHOSTS SHOW UP
- `kasuma`, the kitsune, director of the whole thing, looks dope

- big halloween party, after a while, a group of ghosts led by our bestest friends, they lead us east, in silence

- the sun rises and cho isn't here
- as we get to the edge of the woods, a rustling in the undergrowth

- some fucking aggressive ass, prevert ass centipedes after my sister
    - we smack their asses
