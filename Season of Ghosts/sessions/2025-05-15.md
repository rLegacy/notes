# where's cho and where is my fucking breakfast?
- we walk out of the clearing, all a little shocked, it's foggy
    - we come out to the duyue river
    - this is some thick fog for the summer
        - we remember a nursery rhyme
            - Lazy Adou took a break, and did not light the lamp that day.This proved to be a big mistake, for then the ghosts came out to play!Hazy mist and moon of blood, all because he just gave up.

- ugly cute and the lantern are gone
    - large scars indicate the spider got up and left
    - keiko finds her lantern, and lights it

- a mile later we run into the eastern watch
    - blood in the air
    - 2 lumps, dead town guards, faces frozen, legs swollen
    - jinkin gremlins, 2, dead by sword wounds
    - we meet `Hai-er`, she's acting shifty
        - a little ways after midnight, `cho` returned, and the monsters came out of the woods

- we head into town, should talk to an elder
- we get to the dawnstep bridge, we see a big pile of rubble and furniture
- we see about 8 gremlins dancing, they're acting like they're scared villagers, mocking us
- a larger figure, reciting really bad poetry, drops 3 names
    - `gurgle gut` the person speaking, is a buso
    - `the gray butcher`
    - `Mo Douqiu`

- we go on a snack run
    - milling houses look empty and ransacked
    - we eat some bread

- we get home, a fucking haunt in our house
    - `hasu` kills it

- there's lots of dead folks, we make our way to the inn
    - `cho` and another miller with pitchforks
        - he regails us with the story
    - mother otis, `elizeth` a bunch of folk, they scared

- we head toward the manor, get ganked by some fucking fire faeries in the, clapped their cheeks
- as we head to the manor, we get yoooooo it's the derulos!!
