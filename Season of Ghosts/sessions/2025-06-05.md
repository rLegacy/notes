# poison the bozo time and the kick his ass
- we're at the cd game exchange
- we convince `dr d` to bring the whole gang with him down to the cd game exchange

- `zheng` gathered up 2 boats and 2 fishermen to get us across the river

# the encounter
- we send `keiko` & `dipper` ahead in pest form w/ the poison
    - they make it and make it back

- we fight him, cob gets chomped, gurglebitch gets clapped

- we re-light the lantern w/ the three coins, the mist gets pushed out until it's all gone

- we see the ruin of downtown for the first time.
    - the governor's mansion is gone
