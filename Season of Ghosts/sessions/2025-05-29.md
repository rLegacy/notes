# who's going in the drink?
- there's a faint, glowing ripple in the water, on the fingertips of the dead bodies floating around
    - there are non-quieted spirits in the water
        - the shrine to the `*lady nanbyo*`, godess of natural disasters
    - with the aid of `hasu`, `dipper` attempts to send the souls

- `hasu` captains the boat, the rest of us row
    - we lose ourselves in the fog, and little hands grab up at us
    - we land just east of downtown
        - screams echo from downtown

- northridge is way more ransacked than the south, not as many bodies
    - snake bites
    - blade wounds
    - bite and chew marks, insect related

- we get to the `[hand of the spring]`, it's boarded up, we hear hissing and growling and thumping
    - centipedes, a ghostly gecko, and a fucking giant cockroach try to give us the business
    - it's `dr Dami`, my mannnn
        - `huo`, the tinkerer, came to town about 5 years ago to help maintain the dam, and now runs it, and `[second best]`
        - `jed`, `ed`, the angry old men who live in townhomes
        - `jubei`, the only apprentice of the nagaji, snake people, wizard, creator of the mother's coil
            - only wizard in town

- `dr dami` hooks us up with the blue juice, dream time tea, normally taken in very small amounts
    - he decants us a foe bottle of wine filled with the juice
    - a man of medicine, but also a man of nature, the gecko was a spirit who came to protect us

# we head toward granny hues
- a lot of the same, debris, houses bashed in, shits on fire, sounds from downtown echo out, but grow quieter as we distance ourselves
- everything has been pushed to downtown

- we head to the mushroom house, no sign of scuffle

- we head to `CD exchange`
    - `kim gu-won`, in charge, opens the door after `granny hue` yells at him
    - more military looking established thing going on, `zhen peng` is here, guard captain, they look like they're 
    - `luda bama` tells us the same thing everyone else had, they came from all over
        - she thought she saw `jay`

- we get badges
- we can't arrest other town guards
- they're trying to consolidate survivors

- children missing, headed to the `drying yards`
    - her grandaughter with them

# we get to the drying yards
- the jenkins rigged this into a trap
- we disarm it, due to aid + guidance
    - they were out partying, couple of jenkins come out, and they get tied up
    - open mouth of a snake carved into one of the wood piles, a trap makers signature
        - also got jubei's ankle
        - `mo dookie`?
