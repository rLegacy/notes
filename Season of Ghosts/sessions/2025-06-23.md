# we sleep
- we tell `matsuki` what's up, he asks us to take care of down town
- `yong` gave us healing potions and talismans

# we head down town
- tracks and blood everywhere, broken weapons

# the guards place
- bloody tracks to the north, a bunch of dead horses
    - it's an infested stable, gross, we squish them bugs
    - the bloody tracks lead to the town square

- in the town square, we got jenkins acting
    - they were good, and then they were bad

- it's the grey butcher, an ugly mother fucker, an animate apron

- we follow the bloody tracks to the bathhouse
    - `de-ge`, halfling,  is locked in locker
        - he's got a crush on `hasu` oooooOOOOoo
    - a bunch of turtle people were in here, `kappas`

- bob, dob, lob, nob, frank, they live by gourd lake, got a message from `mo dookie`, he said to come, and they ate some horses.
    - `mo dookie` looks like jay

- we run into the grey butcher again, he points us to the west to go see `mo dookie`
    - we kick his dick in
