# the journey to the rocks overlooking the path
- the shrine of the future, and the butterfly effect of decisions

- we begin the journey
    - the wind and rain pick up
    - we feel like we're trapped under a bowl of dark clouds

- we're climbing, 35ft of sheet rock face to our left
- 2 god damn lanterns give us the shake down

- we arrive in the caldera, a richly forrested crater of a small long dormant volcano
    - at the end of the path a small shrine, with an arch up to the monastary
    - as we approach, the chill in the air fades, and everything is dope...
    - it's like we're in nature heaven
    - a sense of welcoming pride and an unmistakeable sense of peril
    - inside the small shrine at the entrance there have been left gifts
