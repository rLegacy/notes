**Teeth-Clenching Teamwork**

*Willowshore’s residents help one another despite differences.*
- You can attempt to request help from another Willowshore resident even if they’re indifferent or unfriendly, but you do so with a –2 circumstance penalty.

**The Eternal Lantern**
- This minor artifact is an immobile object gifted to the town of Willowshore by the founder of the `[Tan Sugi Monastery]`, `Zhi Hui`. For the town’s entire history, the Eternal Lantern has stood sentinel near the settlement’s heart, its light never wavering after Zhi Hui placed a few copper coins within it. Some believe that it’s possible to receive blessings from the deities whose shrines stand in Willowshore by placing copper coins within the Eternal Lantern in exchange for additional protection, but for the most part, the people of Willowshore have become used to the ever-burning lantern at the southern steps of `[Dawnstep Bridge]`.

## Locations
### `[Eternal Blaze Ironworks]` (W1)
In the days of the monastery’s construction, the Eternal Blaze Ironworks was responsible for creating metal items from cookware, woodworking tools, and small metal parts, such as hinges, locks, and keys for chests. `Yong Wu-Xiu` *(female kitsune blacksmith)* inherited the business from her father about a decade ago.
- Wares: metalworks, adventuring gear (especially cookware), metal armor, metal weapons, metal shields

### `[Willowshore Stables]` (W2)
Willowshore Stables is the town’s veterinary facility for household animals, pets, and livestock. Incidentally, Willowshore Stables’ use of livestock as beasts of burden influenced the village’s food culture, causing many households to avoid the consumption of beef. The owner, `Kum Soon-chong` *(male human veterinarian)*, and his teenage son, `Meng-sung` *(male human veterinarian)*, are well-known for their affable attitudes and compassion for all kinds of animals.
- Wares: animal rentals, barding, saddle bags, land vehicles

### `[Abadar Shrine]` (W3)
This darkwood-trimmed shrine houses a 3-foot-tall limestone statue of `*Abadar*` that holds a shovel in one hand and a trowel in the other. The statue was reportedly taken to `[Goka]` first to ritualistically invite Abadar’s divine blessings at the Grand Bank before being ferried back to Willowshore.

### `[Graveside Manners]` (W4)
Willowshore’s residents practiced cremation in its early days to prevent undeath. The tombs in this old cemetery house the urns of many of those early settlers. Today, only a few families use Graveside Manners as a burial ground. The headstones remain free of lichen and moss thanks to the graveyard’s keeper, `You So-Jin` *(female elf herbalist)*. Once a pilgrim who frequented the `[Tan Sugi monastery]`, So-Jin settled in Willowshore after the monastery’s collapse and maintains an herbalist shop—the primary reason anyone visits Graveside Manners today.
- Wares: alchemical elixirs and tools, alchemical reagents, fresh and dried herbs

### `[Silvermist Lodges]` (W5)
The Silvermist Lodges are split between two small compounds in the woods south of town. At each location, the lodges’ woodwork conforms to the grain of the wood, giving the buildings an organic look associated with elven architecture. In the days when Willowshore first tried to become self-sufficient, eight elven adventurers came and took up an offer to settle in the village, seeing the request as a short-term contract given their life spans. Though none of these original eight elves live in Willowshore anymore, they left many offspring and descendants behind.
- Wares: animal parts, snare supplies

### `[Matsuki Estate]` (W6)
The man that Willowshore calls `“Old” Matsuki` *(male human carpenter)* once apprenticed to the head carpenter of the `[Tan Sugi monastery]`. After taking leave from his master, he led his family to construct a large Tian-shu/Minkaian estate to house all two dozen of them. Reportedly, the superstitious patriarch then made sure that the outer walls were whitewashed with limestone containing blessed salts and holy water. Today, Old Matsuki is the most influential of `(Willowshore’s Southbank faction)` and serves as the faction’s spokesman.

### `[Thrice-Blessed Inn]` (W7)
Willowshore’s Thrice-Blessed Inn began as the Thrice-Blessed Brothel, for it was founded by three clerics of `*Kofusachi*`, `*Calistria*`, and `*Shelyn*`. Political complications forced the brothel’s owner, `Mother Otis` *(genderfluid half-elf innkeeper)*, to shut down the establishment only a few years before `(Lung Wa)`’s collapse. With the aid of Willowshore’s local lawyer, `Luo Xi Yang`, Mother Otis was able to rely upon an obscure law that prevented their eviction and allowed them to continue to operate the building as an inn.

### `[Milling Houses]` (W8)
Willowshore has numerous millhouses, including two powered by water, three by wind, and ten powered by people or draft animals. The abundance ensures that losing one or two mills to routine maintenance or malfunction never jeopardizes the village’s needs. Work at the mills is intense, and the hours can be irregular due to the demand each day. The millers’ leader, `Choe Chung-hu` *(male human miller)*, keeps morale high with encouragement, pushing back against unreasonable demands, keeping wages stable, and offering midnight snacks.
- Wares: De-husked grain, grain flour, stone objects

### `[Nine Ear Shrine]` (W9)
This mud-wall hut looks like a grain storage hut from the outside. Its interior descends 10 feet underground into an enclosed space lined with stone, in the middle of which sits a 15-foot-tall marble statue of a nine-tailed fox. A large spiritual rope made of hay hangs off its neck. The walls of the basement are decorated with painted carvings that depict stories of `*Daikitsu*`. Fifteen years ago, a desperate mother of the Ouh family hid her baby here as the family was rounded up for execution by a corrupt guard. By the time the guards learned about the missing offspring, a large skulk of foxes had surrounded the temple. Unwilling to tempt divine wrath, the guards retreated. Allies of the family soon arrived to rescue the baby, at which point the foxes vanished. That baby, `Ba-Ming Ouh` *(female human priest)*, grew up under the care of distant relatives. While she shows signs of the Ouh family’s inclinations toward the veneration of nature, Ba-Ming wishes to return her life debt by serving Daikitsu. While some question her intentions, most Willowshorers support her dedication.
- Wares: fulus, scrolls, talismans

### `[Lady of Souls]` (W10)
One of `(Lung Wa)`’s chief concerns when they first expanded into Willowshore was to reduce the likelihood of an undead uprising. They solved it by building a cathedral to `*Pharasma*`. `Elizeth Candora` *(female human cleric)*, a second-generation Taldan from `[Goka]`, is the current priestess here. Having once visited Willowshore and the `[Tan Sugi monastery]` as a child, Elizeth never imagined that becoming a cleric of Pharasma would lead to an opportunity for her to permanently return to the village she vividly recalls. She sees the coincidence as fate arranged by Pharasma’s hands and therefore serves dutifully and diligently. She’s fond of spending time alone in the graveyard with her flute and often plays the instrument there to help soothe the spirits of those recently buried therein.
- Wares: consumable religious items, divine scrolls

### `[Dawnstep Bridge]` (W11)
After the `[Thrice-Blessed Brothel]` was established (but before it became an inn), Willowshore’s population had grown enough in size to be considered a town by `[Shenmen]` standards, meaning that a lit lantern must be maintained at all times within the town near the entrance, at a major crossroads, or at a bridge. The lack of a lit lantern at one of these locations suggests that the town is abandoned, which is believed to invite vermin, ghosts, dangerous beasts, and worse. Today, Willowshore features two such lanterns, but the one that stands here, the Eternal Lantern, is both its oldest and most notable.

### `[Industrial District]` (W12)
Willowshore’s `(Lung Wa)` lumber bosses had a host of other businesses related to materials taken from the woods. Many industrial workers came to Willowshore explicitly for this work, leaving family and friends behind. After the lumber bosses left, `Governor Heh` seized control and ordered the laborers to continue working. Upset that they had no choice in the matter, they’ve been gathering late at night under the guidance of `Kawaka` *(male tengu guild leader)*, a senior bookmaker, to discuss how they should negotiate with the governor to release those who want to leave and fairly pay those who elect to stay.

With the collapse of Lung Wa, many of the businesses that once thrived here have closed up shop. The only ones still functioning are `[Cloud Paper House]` *(a paper mill run by Kwaka)*, `[Jadeite Essentials]` *(a distillery)*, and `[Rebel’s Leatherworks]` *(a tannery)*.
- Wares: alcohol, essential oils and perfume, glassware and glass items, hide and leather items, paper and paper products such as spellbooks and formula books

### `[Woodraft Lake]` (W13)
The first governor appointed to Willowshore by `(Lung Wa)` made an effort to tame the notorious `[Ceiba River]` through various engineering feats. Part of that effort, plus the demand for wet storage for wood, led to the construction of the `[Willowshore Dam]` and by extension, Woodraft Lake.

Many protested the construction at first, as the resulting lake would submerge some homes and farmlands—including the village’s shrine to `*Lady Nanbyo*`. A few imprisonments later, all complaints ceased. The dam was completed in due time. While the governor earned themself a promotion and left Willowshore soon after, they didn’t get to enjoy before a landslide buried them on a bright sunny day.

While the story’s veracity is somewhat dubious, subsequent governors have never stopped Willowshore’s villagers from treating the lake as a shrine to the Widow of Suffering.

### `[Willowshore Dam]` (W14)
Willowshore’s dam is a minor engineering marvel. Its main body is constructed out of immense, precisely fitted slabs of dark-gray marble, carved with a carefully calculated curvature. The dam has two giant wooden gates that can be closed or opened to lower the level of the lake. Turning the wheel that controls the gates automatically causes a bell to ring, signaling anyone downriver to move away to safety.

### `[Downtown Willowshore]` (W15)
Downtown Willowshore remains a major hub of activity in town. To the northeast stands the governor’s home and office, which also serves as the village’s bank and treasury. South of the manor lie the imperial barracks, commanded by `Zheng Peng` *(male human watch officer)*. To the north of the crossroad is the stage for the village’s weekly **Shu Opera performance**, which is part of the `[Seven-Colored Songbird theater]`, a venue officiated over by `Kazuma Oono` *(male kitsune director)*. Nearby on opposite sides of the road is one of Willowshore’s busiest stores, `[Treesparrow’s Rest]`, and Willowshore’s only public bathhouse, the `[Happy Kappa]`. Treesparrow’s is a family-owned grocery store run by `Nadoya Sanmi` *(female human family matriarch)*, while the Happy Kappa’s owner, `De-Ge Hua` *(male halfling bathhouse owner)* is famous in town for his obsession with cleanliness.
- Wares: alcohol, bathing, entertainment, grains, household supplies and tools, preserved foods, rations

### `[Luo and Laws]` (W16)
`(Lung Wa)`’s laws, after being revised time and time again by self-serving rulers, are a bag of contradictions allowing independent lawyers, such as `Luo Xi Yang` *(female human lawyer)*, to make a decent living attempting to make sense of them. Promised by the lumber lords who invited her here that rural life would be less stressful, Xi Yang arrived with only the essential 10-volume Imperial Compendium. Quickly, the lawyer discovered that Willowshore’s legal issues were as complicated, if not more so, than what she’d previously encountered in the city of Sze, and thus her library grew to a size that doubled the one in her former home.

### `[Mercantile Street]` (W17)
Willowshore’s newer businesses, particularly those associated with woodcarving, are mostly found in one of the two-storied red-brick buildings along Mercantile Street. To ensure the lumber lords would never favor anyone, the woodcarvers came together to form a guild, through which young apprentices have the opportunity to intern at different shops during their apprenticeship. `Yun Mong-Un` *(female human woodcarver)*, the woodcarver’s current elected guild leader, is a product of such training. Though heaped with praise for her work, Mong-Un would rather be a painter or jewelry maker.
- Wares: artwork, wood items, wooden religious symbols

### `[Second Best]` (W18)
When `Huo Tian-Zhe` *(male human inventor)* arrived in Willowshore with his blacksmith father from `[Karahai]` *(Willowshore’s closest neighboring settlement to the east)* about five years ago to assist with the maintenance of Willowshore’s dam, the urban-born son thought he was about to show the “second-rated smiths of the countryside” how to get things done. Quickly, Tian-Zhe realized his own skills were subpar to even the youngest apprentice of the `[Eternal Blaze]` and that his fancily-designed farm gadgets were more akin to toys than machines of marvels. Humbled, Tian-Zhe asked his father to stay in Willowshore so he could learn to be a “smith of use.” Begrudgingly accepting the abrupt request, Tian-Zhe’s father nevertheless gave his son a handful of gold to order a new shop sign. As a reminder to himself, Tian-Zhe boldly named his workshop “Second Best.” In the last five years, Tian-Zhe’s products have garnered some loyal customers, and his knowledge of machinery won over `Yong Wu-Xiu` such that the old smith tasked him with the maintenance of the dam.
- Wares: adventuring tools, alchemical ammunition, alchemical bombs, clockwork gadgets, and simple armor, metal weapons, and shields

### `[The Hand of Spring]` (W19)
Willowshore relied heavily on home remedies, herbal droughts, and traveling priests for medical care until the arrival of `Doctor Damihansig Mababangloob`, `dr Dami`, *(male human doctor)*, whom everyone calls Dami for short. Dami uses a mix of acupuncture, purified chemicals, and surgery to provide care. Though his treatments aren’t what Willowshore is used to, Dami has developed quite a reputation for being a charitable doctor who cares more about his patients than monetary gain.
- Wares: alchemical healing items, healer’s kit supplies, nonmagical healing items

### `[Mother’s Coil]` (W20)
Magic was traditionally seen in Willowshore as either a manifestation of divine blessing, one’s connection to the spirit world, or just a trick of the hand and mind. Most folks didn’t quite understand it as a topic to be studied and learned until the arrival of `Anjal of Thulsadus`, an old nagaji wizard. Arriving about 15 years ago, Anjal found the weather of Willowshore to be gentle on their dryscale condition and thus bought a plot of land from a farmer looking to relocate to the city of `[Sze]`. Overnight, a Nagajor-styled tower of dark basalt appeared, much to the awe of the villagers.

Though curious about magic, most villagers find the topic to be formidable and unapproachable, not to mention impractical. Thus, Anjal had only one apprentice, `Jubei`, a child they raised after she was abandoned in Willowshore by a pair of irresponsible “parents” who posed as well-off merchants but then fled town without paying their bills. Infuriated that anyone dared endanger a child so, Anjal’s`* Nalinivatian*` beliefs prompted the old wizard to take the terrified Jubei in as their own.

Jubei has since grown into a capable young adult. While Anjal’s death last year was tragic, Jubei is determined to continue studying the arcane arts through the books her adopted parent left behind.
- Wares: arcane and occult scrolls, formulas and recipes, wands

### `[The Ceiba-Duyue Exchange]`, `CD Exchange` (W21)
When `Governor Heh Shan-Bao` took office in Willowshore, he ordered several new warehouses and a trade office to be built here, hoping to expand the town’s industry and connection with the coastal fortress of Karahai. On `Granny Hu`’s advice, Shan-Bao handpicked the local `*Kofusachi*` priest, `Kim Gu-won` *(male human cleric)*, to take the post of Exchange Manager. Gu-won reluctantly accepted the job, knowing that with what Granny Hu has on him, he wouldn’t be able to refuse.
- Wares: beverages, divine scrolls, foods and spices, fulus, raw mineral, textiles

### `[Fisheries]` (W22)
Fish is an important food source for Willowshore. Locals traditionally capture entire schools of fish, preserve those above a certain size, and raise small ones in their backyard ponds. Today, this practice has been expanded, though the fishers have yet to reach a point where the fishery ponds here can be maintained indefinitely. `Zataku` *(female ratfolk fisher)* is Willowshore’s foremost fish keeper; her ability to sense weather changes gives her the perfect edge in her occupation.
- Wares: dried or smoked fish and shrimp, fertilizer, fishing gear, insect bait

### `[Dock]` (W23)
After the construction of the dam, Willowshore’s old dock was blocked off, thus requiring the construction of a new dock at the mouth of the `[Ceiba River]`. The new dock is operated and managed by `Rajul Samudra` *(male nagaji shipwright)*, who was hired by the `(Ceiba-Duyue Exchange)` specifically for his boatbuilding skills.
- Wares: river boat rentals and sales

### `[The Mushroom House]` (W24)
This remote brick farmhouse smells of decay and manure. Everyone knows that mushrooms aren’t the only things growing in the farmhouse, though. For the right price, the Mushroom House can grow almost anything. `Luda Bama` *(female halfling smuggler)*, a spry, elderly halfling woman, is the head of this illicit market, which she runs with the explicit permission of `Granny Hu`.
- Wares: adventuring gear, drugs, poisons, tattoos

### `[The Cerulean Teahouse]` (W25)
Willowshore’s lumber bosses thought very highly of themselves, and the idea of mingling with the “common folk” rankled them. Aristocrat `Qing Mai-Lai`’s solution was the establishment of this fine structure, close to the lumber lords’ estates. The Cerulean Teahouse took off quickly, thanks to its plentiful offerings of extravagant food, drinks, and performances. However, once the novelty wore off, business quickly died. Still, Mai-Lai persevered, first by changing the teahouse’s focus to banquet catering, then by collaborating with `[The Leshy’s Salon]` as a storefront, and finally as a flexible bed-and-breakfast. Just days after Mai-Lai finally paid off the loan on the property, news of `(Lung Wa)`’s collapse reached Willowshore. Mai-Lai called it quits at that point and announced her retirement, but her attempts to transfer control of the Teahouse to family met with complications after it became apparent that none of her relations wanted to move to Willowshore. When Mai-Lai passed away early in the previous winter, ownership of the business was still undetermined, for Mai-Lai never submitted a will. Today, the Cerulean Teahouse stands vacant and is slowly falling into ruin.

### `[Abandoned Estates]` (W26)
The abandoned lumber lords’ estates, after being thoroughly picked clean, were left to serve as the occasional rage room or dare challenge. An abandoned shrine to `*Desna*` sits in one of the houses, and many have questioned if someone should accept the goddess into their home instead of leaving her bereft in the estate ruins.

### `[The Leshy’s Saloon]` (W27)
The local leshies don’t recall when they came to the region, just that it was long before Willowshore was founded. They didn’t officially join Willowshore until the expansion of the settlement made it inevitable. With allied families keeping the greedy lumber lords away, the leshies built their own tea farm business, taking to the roads with brewed tea and teaware stashed in rectangular bamboo backpacks. Some would shout slogans, while others used a simple temple block to inform customers of their arrival. These traveling merchants soon became an attraction and staple of Willowshore life. Ever since the Cerulean Teahouse closed, `Mountain Summit Grass` *(agender leshy teamaker)*, the leader of this band of leshies, has been increasingly focusing on creating bespoke blends of tea for individual local customers they favor.
- Wares: clay pottery tea ware, tea leaves

### `[Bones of the Forgotten]` (W28)
Willowshore, like many remote villages, has its own set of laws. Grievous crimes were punished with exile unless the individual’s skill or knowledge was needed— the punishment was then permanent imprisonment. Executions were rare, as being exiled into `[Specterwood]` was often a death sentence in itself.

Particularly vile criminals had a Mark of Crime tattooed onto their scalp, and after death, this tattoo was transferred to the bones through carving, meaning even in death and decomposition, the mark remained. Bodies with a Mark of Crime—be it from Willowshore, another village, or `(Lung Wa)`—can only be buried in this overgrown and unkept area.

While graves were unmarked in the past, a few wooden posts have been erected recently and paper shuriken hung off them, seemingly in silent protest that the ones buried beneath might have died an unjust death. Or perhaps this is an attempt to stave off the rise of a bitter, vengeful ghost.

### `[The Great Willow]` (W29)
Willowshore rests at the foot of a mountainous region known geographically as the Trimountains, named due to the three major peaks in the area. In her memoir, `Master Zhi Hui` noted how she found an ancient willow tree of unusual size at the summit of the lowest of these mountains. After befriending the kodama kami who protected the tree, Master Zhi Hui learned vital information that eventually led her to the `[Tan Sugi grove]` to the west. For this knowledge, the `*kodama of the so-called “Great Willow”*` has received much reverence from both Willowshore and visiting pilgrims over the years.
- Wares: foraged foods and nonmetallic raw materials

### `[Spider Gate]` (W30)
After the **Night of Broken Blades**, Willowshore’s governor caved to the demand for a new lantern at the entrance of the town to augment the protection afforded by the Eternal Lantern at the town’s heart. While the original plan was for the carpenters of Willowshore to build a tori gate or Tian-shu gateway on which lanterns could be hung, a `(Lung Wa)` aristocrat offered a free stone guardian spider from his garden since it no longer fit in with the garden’s decorations. Most Willowshorers thought the giant statue was the ugliest thing they’d ever seen. Nevertheless, they assumed the statue housed a guardian spirit and respected it accordingly. In time, villagers accepted their unique entrance guardian, even adopting it as their mascot and naming it `“Ugly Cute.”` The lantern Ugly Cute holds in its fangs is a regular lantern, unlike the Eternal Lantern found at Dawnstep Bridge, but the people of Willowshore value it just as much and strive to keep it lit at all times.

## WILLOWSHORE HINTERLANDS
Beyond the town’s borders lies the rugged terrain of its hinterlands—rolling forested hills rising to verdant mountains to the west, while to the east, the region’s largest river eventually flows into the `[Sea of Ghosts]`. Where this river meets the sea stands Willowshore’s closest neighbor, the coastal fortified market called `[Karahai]`, yet even this location is a day’s ride from town.

The immediate hinterlands feature a number of minor sites of interest. The `[Duyue River]` is the largest waterway in the region with Willowshore founded on one of its tributaries, the Ceiba River. A shallower tributary, `[Dragonfly Creek]`, winds south to an open area of rugged stone known as the `[Gorge of Fangs and Teeth]` — a natural quarry that supplied the stone for Willowshore’s roads and foundations. `[Gourd Lake]`, downriver from Willowshore, provides excellent fishing, but those who would ply its waters would do well to make offerings to the kappas who dwell in its depths and cavort on its southern shores. `[Green Silk Peak]`, nearly 2,000 feet high, is the highest point of elevation in the hinterlands, while the natural sinkholes known as the `[Eyes of Fumeiyoshi]` are the opposite — barren pits in the ground where nothing grows and gritty water has pooled.

Signs of habitation beyond Willowshore are sparse in the region, but they do exist and are largely abandoned. To the northeast stand the burnt-out ruins of an abandoned roadhouse once known as `[Canary Inn]`, while a remote Hunter’s Hut stands near the headwaters of the Duyue River. To the north can be found an old expansion once intended to support Willowshore, but these buildings and farms were soon abandoned when it became apparent the stream that flowed through the area tended to dry up at random intervals each year. To the west, near the source of the Ceiba River, are the remains of the old Lumber Camp abandoned a few years ago by the local lumber lords — a location that’s slowly being reclaimed by the forest. And in the low mountains northwest of town, at the far end of the trail known as `[Pilgrim’s Path]`, stand the ruins of the `[Tan Sugi Monastery]` — a place reputed today to be the den of monsters, ghosts, or worse.

The forest surrounding Willowshore is part of
the much larger woodland known as `[Specterwood]`,
although here in Willowshore’s hinterlands, the haunts
and ghosts notorious for plaguing these woods aren’t
as dangerous. Wildlife is abundant with deer and boars
making up the primary large game in the region, and
more dangerous predators like black bears, wolves,
giant stag beetles, and enormous spiders comprise the
greater perils of the hinterlands to those who travel too
far from the roads or explore the wilds after dark.

## BEYOND THE HINTERLANDS
**Central Northern Road**: This partially ruined road winds through several fields that have gone fallow amid the ruins of a village that was abandoned many years ago, then eventually comes to an end at a large wetland known as Moon Marsh for the way the orange, night-blooming flowers that grow there shine under the moonlight.

**Eastern Northern Road**: This road connects Willowshore with numerous small but distant villages and towns scattered throughout Specterwood and eventually finds its way to the Gossamer Mountains. The next closest settlement down this road is Foxhollow, but it’s three days’ travel and even smaller than Willowshore.

**Eastern Road**: This road leads to the trade fortress of Karahai and represents Willowshore’s major economic link to the rest of Shenmen. Karahai has a small village (quite a bit smaller than Willowshore) nearby—the trade fortress itself being one of many economic hubs along the west coast of the Sea of Ghosts.

**Northeastern Road**: This road leads to a recently established farmstead on a bluff overlooking the Sea of Ghosts, a cattle ranch owned by a notoriously ruthless expatriate politician from the city of Sze who doesn’t have much to do with Willowshore.

**Northwest Trail**: This old overgrown trail leads off into the forest; most folks believe it leads to a long-abandoned shrine, but few travel this remote path today.

**Southern Road**: The southern road is a long overland route that eventually connects to better maintained roads and more populous villages and towns several days’ travel to the south, but most in Willowshore call it the “Apple Road,” as it leads to a grove of wild apple trees that produce particularly delicious fruit every fall.
