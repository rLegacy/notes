    - `[Tan Sugi Monastery]` was founded by a Sangpotshi monk named `Zhi Hui`. Built around an ancient sugi tree said to have mystic properties, the Tan Sugi Monastery was incredibly remote, nestled in a wooded valley within an unsettled reach of Specterwood.
    - `[Willowshore]` was originally founded to support those who built the monastery, and the long trail that connected the town to the monastery became known as the Pilgrim’s Path. Once construction of the monastery ended, `[Willowshore]`’s focus shifted to an increasingly self-sufficient lifestyle that only periodically needed to support the monks.
